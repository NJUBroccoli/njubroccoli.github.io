## Hobbies

I love thinking and coding. Thanks to my course assignments, I successfully implemented x86 ISA and its emulator, an operating system with its own thread library and file system, a C-- compiler translated into MIPS, and a naïve graphic drawing application supporting drawing, manipulation and clipping.

In spare time, I developed a 3D Tower Defense Game with Unity3D, and also developed a VSCode extension <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Broccoli.cba-vscode">Coding Behavior Analysis</a> to analyze users&#39; coding behavior like coding speed, coding accuracy and frequency of typed characters. Also, I set up a blog website with Flask. All in all, learning to code is funny, although sometimes bitter (especially when debugging with dependencies unknown).

Watching videos (especially Anime), working out in gyms, cooking, and walking compose most of my leisure time.
