## How to Make A Good Technical Report?

- Reporting is just like telling story. The requirements of research work are consistent with the requirements of storytelling.
  + **Significance:** Why do you tell this story? Why should I listen to it?
  + **Novelty:** Is your story itself interesting?
  + **Presentation:** Can you make me understand your story and also feel interesting?

### Design of Report

- Design your report based on the audience’s **background**. In other words, **always remember where you are reporting.** Don't report to peers in other research fields as if they were your supervisors and had already known everything you just said. Among the following cases, the assumptions you can make about the audience’s background are getting weaker and weaker.
  + Case 1: In an individual meeting with your supervisor.
  + Case 2: In a group meeting with your supervisor and colleagues working on similar topics.
  + Case 3: In a conference with many peers in your research field (e.g., ICSE or PLDI).
  + Case 4: In a conference with many researchers working on different research fields of computer science (e.g., CNCC).

>If your report has to include something your expected audience have no background about, you should add these background knowledge into your report while ensuring them *well motivated* and *easily understood*.

- Pay attention to the given **time limit** when designing your report, which may determine the level of detail you can cover. "But I was given only three minutes" is not the reason for your bad report. Practice well and control your time!

### Slides

In your slides, the following points need to be well done.
- **Logic Chain:** The logic chain is the core of a report. 
  + Delete anything unnecessary to the logic chain.
  + Everything should be *well motivated*, including your research topic, problem scope, idea/insight, design choice, and experimental design. "Others are doing it so I am doing it" is a bad motivation.
- **Intuition:** Make your audience quickly develop an intuition about anything you report. Learn to use examples and diagrams.
- **Attention:** Always pay attention to and guide the audience’s attention. Don't play with the audience's attention. Don’t waste too much time on unimportant pieces. (thanks to Yanyan Jiang)
- **Terminology:** *One* terminology can only refer to *one* thing throughout your report. Don’t do meaningless terminology switch and don’t propose new but unnecessary terminology. Your audience cannot remember so many things at once. (thanks to Qinlin Chen and Yiding Li)
- **Formalization:** In principle, your report should not contain any formalization, because each formalization will cause a lot of burden on the audience. If something must be formalized, please use clear explanations and examples to ensure that your audience can develop intuition on it.
- **Visibility:** Ensure that anything in your slides can be clearly seen by everyone, including the text in any picture. Don't show anything that your audience cannot see clearly.
- **Text Using:** Don't use text in any place that can be expressed more clearly with diagrams or directed lines. A large paragraph of text shouldn't appear anywhere in your slides. Why do your audience have to read so many words?
- **Number/Bullet Using:** Sequential numbers (e.g., 1. 2. 3.) and bullet points (·) have different meanings, where the former emphasizes the presentation *order* more than the latter. Please use them appropriately. Even if you choose the bullet points, you still need to organize the logic between each point. (thanks to Yanyan Jiang)
