## Hobbies

I love coding and implementing what I want to come true. Thanks to my course assignments, I once implemented x86 ISA and its emulator, an operating system with its own thread library and file system, a C-- compiler translated into MIPS and a na√Øve graphic drawing software supporting drawing, manipulation and clipping. I completed all of them and achieved good marks.

In spare time, I developed a 3D Tower Defense Game by Unity3D and developed a VSCode extension [Coding Behavior Analysis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Broccoli.cba-vscode) to analyze users' coding behavior like coding speed, coding accuracy and frequency of typed characters. Also, I set up a blog website with database by Flask. Learning to code is funny and sometimes bitter (when debugging).

Watching J-anime, Walking and drinking milk tea compose most of my leisure time.
